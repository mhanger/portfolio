                <p>Built data analytics for both startups looking to impress, as well as enterprise clients looking to upgrade their capabilities.

                <p>I led a team of five near-shore developers on a new e-commerce project for a major grocery store chain in the Midwest. The front-end stack consisted of Next, React, GraphQL, and the styled-components library for visual layout. Responsibilities included interviewing, hiring, and managing the team, interacting with stakeholders, project managers, quality assurance, and analytics team leaders to drive the scope of work. Additional contributions included recommending architectural solutions and mentoring team members on solutions at a story level in a highly agile environment.  I also contributed to coding stories to create re-usable react components within the client's microservice ecosystem.</p>
